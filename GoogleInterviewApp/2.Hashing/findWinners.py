# https://leetcode.com/problems/find-players-with-zero-or-one-losses/editorial/

# You are given an integer array matches where matches[i] = [winneri, loseri] 
# indicates that the player winneri defeated player loseri in a match.

# Return a list answer of size 2 where:

# answer[0] is a list of all players that have not lost any matches.
# answer[1] is a list of all players that have lost exactly one match.

# Input: matches = [[1,3],[2,3],[3,6],[5,6],[5,7],[4,5],[4,8],[4,9],[10,4],[10,9]]
# Output: [[1,2,10],[4,5,7,8]]

# Input: matches = [[2,3],[1,3],[5,4],[6,4]]
# Output: [[1,2,5,6],[]]
