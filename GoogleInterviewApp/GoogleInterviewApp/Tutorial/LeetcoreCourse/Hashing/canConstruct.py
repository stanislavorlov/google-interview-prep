# Given two strings ransomNote and magazine, return true if ransomNote can be constructed 
# by using the letters from magazine and false otherwise.

# Each letter in magazine can only be used once in ransomNote.

# Input: ransomNote = "a", magazine = "b"
# Output: false

# Input: ransomNote = "aa", magazine = "ab"
# Output: false

# Input: ransomNote = "aa", magazine = "aab"
# Output: true
