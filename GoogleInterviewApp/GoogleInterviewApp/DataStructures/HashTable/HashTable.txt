Hash Table is a data structure which organizes data using hash functions in order to support quick insertion and search.

There are two different kinds of hash tables: hash set and hash map.
- The hash set is one of the implementations of a set data structure to store no repeated values.
- The hash map is one of the implementations of a map data structure to store (key, value) pairs.

By choosing a proper hash function a wonderful performance can be achieved.

Insertion:
    We parse the keys through the hash function to map into corresponding bucket.
Search:
    We parse the keys through the same hash function and search only in specific bucket.

Hash function - the most important component
