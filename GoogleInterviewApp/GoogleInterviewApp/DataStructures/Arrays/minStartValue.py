# Given an array of integers nums, you start with an initial positive value startValue.
# In each iteration, you calculate the step by step sum of startValue plus elements in nums (from left to right).
# Return the minimum positive value of startValue such that the step by step sum is never less than 1.

# nums = [-3,2,-3,4,2]
